//! The server-session **engine**: the database state a connection holds across
//! statements.
//!
//! Until now nothing owned live state between statements. `stele-server::run`
//! built the storage backend and immediately dropped it; the pgwire front end
//! ([STL-104]) was stateless and could only answer a constant `SELECT`; every
//! other consumer (`stele-sim`'s identity demo) hand-wired a `Wal`/`Delta`/
//! `ValidityIndex`/`DmlWriter`/`Catalog` inline. [`SessionEngine`] is the missing
//! piece both DDL routing ([STL-131]) and DML/SELECT routing ([STL-147]) sit on:
//! one handle that owns
//!
//! * the [`Catalog`] — created/dropped tables and their schemas at a snapshot;
//! * a monotonic **commit clock** ([`MonotonicClock`]) supplying the
//!   [`SystemTimeMicros`] that DDL `apply(at:)` and every DML commit stamp with;
//! * each table's storage tiers — a [`stele_storage::engine::Engine`] bundling its
//!   WAL, delta tier, validity index, and sealed segments, on a per-table
//!   [`NamespacedDisk`] view of the one configured backend.
//!
//! and exposes a single [`execute`](SessionEngine::execute) entry point the pgwire
//! loop calls per parsed [`Statement`]: DDL and `SELECT` route by pattern-matching
//! the bound statement. (`INSERT`/`UPDATE`/`DELETE` binding is [STL-149]; until it
//! lands they reach the engine through the typed [`insert`](SessionEngine::insert)
//! / [`update`](SessionEngine::update) / [`delete`](SessionEngine::delete)
//! methods.)
//!
//! ## Runtime-agnostic
//!
//! This crate is part of the deterministic core ([ADR-0010]): it depends only on
//! storage/catalog/sql/exec, never on `tokio` or wall-clock reads. The async
//! daemon ([`stele-server`]) constructs and drives a `SessionEngine`, but the
//! engine itself runs identically under the sim scheduler — which is what lets the
//! whole connection lifecycle be replayed bit-for-bit from a seed.
