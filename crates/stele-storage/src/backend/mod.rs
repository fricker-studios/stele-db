//! Pluggable storage backend — the runtime-agnostic I/O seam ([STL-90]).
//!
//! Every byte the storage engine reads or writes flows through the [`Disk`] /
//! [`DiskFile`] traits. A production binary wires in [`local::LocalDisk`] (real
//! filesystem); tests and the deterministic simulation harness drive
//! [`memory::MemDisk`] (heap-backed, with optional fault injection). A future
//! `s3` backend ([ADR-0007](../../../../docs/adr/0007-storage-compute-separation.md),
//! v0.3+) slots in behind the same trait.
//!
//! ## Why this is the "StorageBackend" the ticket names
//!
//! The trait pair here *is* the pluggable `StorageBackend` of [STL-90]. It grew
//! up inside the WAL ([STL-86]) because that was the first writer to need it,
//! then segments ([STL-88]) and the delta tier ([STL-87]) adopted it. This
//! module is its promotion out of `wal` into a workspace-level seam; `wal`
//! re-exports the names for source compatibility.
//!
//! ## Append-only, not random-write
//!
//! The ticket sketches a `write_at` primitive, but Stele's storage is
//! append-only: the WAL only ever appends, and a sealed segment is immutable
//! once written ([architecture §12 invariant 1](../../../../docs/02-architecture.md#12-cross-cutting-architectural-invariants)).
//! So [`DiskFile`] exposes [`append`](DiskFile::append) (logical `O_APPEND`),
//! never a positional overwrite. Positional *reads* ([`read_at`](DiskFile::read_at))
//! are fine — sealed segments are read at arbitrary offsets. The absence of
//! in-place rewrite is also what keeps this contract implementable by an
//! object store — see [`conformance`] for the expectations a new backend
//! must meet.
//!
//! ## Two durability points
//!
//! [`DiskFile::sync`] makes a file's *contents* durable; [`Disk::sync_dir`] —
//! the directory fence ([STL-232]) — makes the *namespace* durable. Recovery
//! discovers files by listing the disk, so both are load-bearing: the engine
//! fences after creating any file whose existence recovery relies on. The
//! full fsync discipline (which operation syncs what, and when) is documented
//! in [02 — architecture §3.7](../../../../docs/02-architecture.md#37-on-disk-layout--durability-discipline-local-backend).
//!
//! ## Determinism
//!
//! No `tokio` types and no wall-clock reads appear on this surface, satisfying
//! invariant 7 ([architecture §12](../../../../docs/02-architecture.md#12-cross-cutting-architectural-invariants)):
//! the same `Disk` trait is driven by real OS resources in production and by
//! the deterministic [`memory`] backend under the sim scheduler.
